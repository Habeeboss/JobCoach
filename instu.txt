3. Feature Engineering
Extracting useful features (e.g., experience levels, job satisfaction thresholds)
Creating new columns from existing data
4. Data Integration & Merging
Join datasets on common keys (e.g., Seeker_ID from job_seekers_data and matching_outcomes)
Ensure data integrity
5. Model Training (Job Matching AI)
Define target and feature variables
Split data into train-test sets
Train an initial model (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Neural Network)
6. API Deployment for Job Matching AI
Save the trained model (job_matching_model.pkl)
Deploy the model using Azure ML or Flask API for real-time predictions
